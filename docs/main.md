# Welcome

Hello, and welcome to my logic gate simulator! I know it can look kinda scary at first, so that's why i wrote these docs!

I recomand reading the first 3 chapters before you start, and then only dig deeper into the others when you feel you mastered the basics!

# Table of contents

1. [Basic controls](./controls.md)
2. [Importing a custom logic gate](import.md)
