# logicGateSimulator2
a better version of my logic gate simulator

Check out the [demo](https://mateiadrielrafael.github.io/logicGateSimulator/)

To run locally clone this repo, and then run: `npm install`
to install all dependenices, `npm run dev` to start the development server or `npm run build` to bundle it.

This project wouldnt have been possible without the follownig libraries:
- [typescript](https://github.com/microsoft/TypeScript) and [sass](https://github.com/sass/sass)
- [lit-html](https://github.com/Polymer/lit-html) , [lit-rx](https://github.com/Dabolus/lit-rx) and [rxjs](https://github.com/ReactiveX/rxjs)
- [material components for the web](https://github.com/material-components/material-components-web)
- [webpack](https://github.com/webpack/webpack)
- [gh-pages](https://github.com/tschaub/gh-pages)
- [eix-js](https://github.com/eix-js)

I used lit-html, lit-rx and rxjs mainly for the rendering, MCW for the styling, webpack for bundling, gh-pages for deploying and eix-js (a game engine me and a friend are working on) for input handling and common decorators.
